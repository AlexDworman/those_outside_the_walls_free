Such traits include monster senses and how it interacts with certain damage types. They are listed on the same line to conserve space. The common traits are:</p><h3>Debilitations:</h3><p>Debilitations lists circumstances in which a monster has disadvantage on all rolls.</p><h3>Hidden</h3><p>Hidden lists circumstances where a monster is hard to notice. To detect a Hidden monster, a character’s notice check is made against a set DC instead of being contested by the monster. The trait is written as ‘Hidden-X’, where X is the DC. A Hidden monster remains concealed until it is spotted, or it attacks. A revealed creature cannot regain the benefits of being Hidden for the remainder of the scene.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Detecting Hidden Creatures</strong></p><p>Abilities that detect living creatures, magical entities, or other beings may be able to spot a Hidden creature without needing to make a check.</p></blockquote><h3>Halved</h3><p>Damage of the types listed in Halved are divided in half and rounded down.</p><h3>Immunities</h3><p>Damage types the creature is unaffected by are listed in Immunities.</p><h3>Maximums</h3><p>Maximums lists the types of harm a creature is exceptionally vulnerable to. If harmed by these types it takes the maximum possible damage.</p><h3>Minimums</h3><p>Minimums are the opposite of Maximums: Damage types a creature is resistant to. If harmed by these types it takes the minimum possible damage. Minimum damage cannot do less damage than Shock, if any is applicable.</p><h3>Senses</h3><p>If a monster has unusual senses they are listed here. Senses are described on the Common Senses table below.</p><h4>Senses Table</h4><p><em><strong>Arcane Sight:</strong></em> A monster with arcane sight sees auras around magical creatures, effects, and items. Arcane sight pierces darkness and invisibility. Monsters and effects that negate magic are invisible to arcane sight</p><p><em><strong>Echolocation:</strong></em> A creature with echolocation sees the outlines of solid object. Invisible creatures can be detected with echolocation, though incorporeal ones cannot. If a creature with echolocation is deafened, it might also be blinded</p><p><em><strong>Infravision:</strong></em> A monster with infravision perceives the infrared spectrum. This sense pierces darkness. Infravision is blinded by large sources of heat</p><p><strong>Lifesight:</strong> A monster with lifesight can detect living creatures regardless of light levels, though it cannot detect invisible ones. A creature with lifesight sees in the dark unless its surroundings are sterilized</p><p><em><strong>Nightvision:</strong></em> A creature with nightvision sees perfectly in any light level above complete darkness</p><p><em><strong>Psychosense:</strong></em> A creature with psychosense can detect thinking beings’ position and disposition, though nothing else</p><p><em><strong>Tremorsense:</strong></em> A creature with tremorsense detects vibrations through surfaces they are touching. Flying and incorporeal creatures are invisible to tremorsense</p><p></p><blockquote><p><strong>Simplifying Vision</strong></p><p>For a simpler game, assume any creature with special senses has perfect vision in the dark.</p></blockquote><h3>Skill</h3><p>If a monster is particularly talented at certain skills, they are listed here.

They cannot use ranged attacks or abilities, and are immune to visual effects.</p><p>Attack rolls against Blinded Creatures are made with advantage. Blind creatures have disadvantage on melee attacks and saving throws that rely on sight.</p><h2>Cursed</h2><p>A Cursed creature suffers some ill effect until the curse is lifted. This ill effect is listed in parenthesis. See Curses (pg. 2) for lifting curses.</p><h2>Deafened</h2><p>A Deafened Creature cannot hear. They are immune to auditory effects but can still be damaged by destructive sonic waves.</p><h2>Dissolving</h2><p>A Dissolving creature takes 1d6 damage at the start of its turn. If it is still Dissolving at the end of its turn it makes a Luck saving throw. On a failure all of its Readied items susceptible to corrosion gain a point of Item Damage (pg. 2). Removing oneself from contact with corrosive material is sufficient to end the dissolving condition.</p><h2>Enthralled</h2><p>An Enthralled creature follows the commands of the creature that Enthralled it to the best of its ability. The enthraller can issue orders as On Turn actions, though how these issues are ordered depends on the nature of the enthrallment. If the orders are suicidal or against its nature it can make a Mental saving throw, freeing itself on a success. Any penalties on the roll that led to the creature’s Enthrallment apply to throws to free itself.</p><p>Other methods of ending enthrallment depends on how the condition was originally imposed. Psychic Enthrallment ends when the enthraller is incapacitated. Magic Enthrallment can be dismissed, dispelled, or temporarily suppressed. Disease- or Poison-based Enthrallment can be cured. Anything that clears mental effects lifts this condition.</p><p></p><h2>Frail</h2><p>A Frail creature dies if reduced to 0 hit points and cannot naturally regain hit points. A week of bedrest ends this condition, as does a DC Int/Heal check. This check can only be attempted once.</p><p>Frailty is described on page 48 of the core rules.</p><h2>Grappled</h2><p>A grappled creature cannot move or attack with anything other than unarmed attacks. They automatically take damage from their grappler’s unarmed attack at the end of the round, provided they remain grappled. Escaping a grapple requires succeeding on a contested Str/Punch check.</p><p>Grappled is described on page 43 of the core rules.  </p><h2>Ignited</h2><p>An Ignited creature takes 1d6 damage at the start of its turn. If it is still Ignited at the end of its turn it makes a Luck saving throw. On a failure all of its Readied items susceptible to fire gain a point of Item Damage (pg. 2). Spending a Main and Move action to stop, drop, and roll is sufficient to end this condition. Other creatures can spend a Main Action beating out the flames. Immersion in water can also end this condition.</p><h2>Invisible</h2><p>An invisible creature cannot be seen. Melee attacks against them are made with a -4 modifier. Ranged attacks against them are impossible.</p><p>Invisibility is described on page 43 of the core rules, under the spell The Excellent Transpicuous Transformation.</p><h2>Mortally Wounded</h2><p>PCs and important creatures typically become Mortally Wounded at 0 hit points. A Mortally Wounded creature is completely incapacitated. They will die in six rounds unless stabilized. </p><p>Stabilization requires a Dex/Heal or Int/Heal check against a DC of 10 plus the number of rounds the creature has been Mortally Wounded. Proper tools, such as a healer’s pouch, reduce the DC by 2. A creature that has been stabilized is now Frail. </p><p>Mortally Wounded is described on page 48 of the core rules.</p><h2>Paralyzed</h2><p>A Paralyzed creature cannot use any ability, take any action, or succeed on any save that requires motion or vocalization. Attack rolls against paralyzed creatures automatically hit.</p><h2>Petrified</h2><p>A Petrified creature has turned into stone. Lifting the condition is a complex process, typically requiring a beast to be killed or a major project (pg. 336 in the core rules) to be completed. Until cured they are effectively removed from the game and their player should consider creating a new character.</p><p>A Petrified creature has an AC of 22 and cannot be carried as a Readied or Stowed item under normal circumstances. They are suspended as well—they cannot regain hit points or System Strain, but do not suffer from diseases or other ongoing effects. Damage taken while petrified may kill the character if the condition is lifted.</p><h2>Poisoned</h2><p>A Poisoned creature suffers some ill effect for the duration of their poisoning. The effect is denoted in parenthesis. This condition can be ended by an antidote, Purge Ailment or a similar effect, or the poison rules on Page 49 in the core rulebook.</p><h2>Prone</h2><p>A Prone Creature makes melee attacks with a -4 modifier. Ranged attacks against them have a -2 penalty. Melee attacks against them are made with a +2 bonus. Standing up from Prone requires a Move action.</p><p>Prone is described on page 45 of the core rules, and in the Hit Modifier Table on page 43.</p><h2>Restrained</h2><p>A restrained creature has a speed of 0’ and disadvantage on any roll requiring motion. They cannot cast spells or use weapons larger than a shortsword. Attack rolls made against restrained creatures are made with advantage.</p><h2>Sickened</h2><p>A Sickened creature suffers some effect for the duration of their sickness, which is denoted in parenthesis. These effects may be consistent or compound with time. This condition can be ended by Purge Ailment or a similar effect, or the disease rules on Page 48 in the core rulebook.</p><h2>Strained</h2><p>A character at their maximum System Strain is Strained. In most cases nothing happens—the character cannot normally heal or use certain abilities but can otherwise go about their day. Certain monster abilities and attack riders have effects that occur if a character is Strained. Such effects are written as “if Strained (effect)”.</p><h2>Stunned</h2><p>A Stunned creature’s speed is halved. They have disadvantage on any attack rolls, saving throws, or skill checks that require focus. Stunned creatures cannot cast spells. Unless imposed as part of another condition, this condition lifts at the end of a scene.</p><h2>Slowed</h2><p>A Slowed creature loses their Move action.</p><h2>Suffocating</h2><p>A Suffocating creature will run out of air after 1 round for each point of their Constitution score. When out of air, they take 1 hit point of damage for each hit die they have. A creature can remain still to quadruple the amount of time they have. NPCs are assumed to have 10 points of Constitution.</p><p>Suffocating is described on page 49 of the core rules.</p><h2>Swallowed</h2><p>A Swallowed creature is Restrained, Suffocating, and takes damage equal to the swallower’s Hit Dice at the start of each turn. This condition ends upon the swallower’s death or if the Swallowed creature deals damage to the swallower equal to its Hit Dice.</p><p></p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"flags":{},"_stats":{"systemId":"wwn","systemVersion":"1.1.0","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1673819529990,"modifiedTime":1674486469945,"lastModifiedBy":"aD9eqh5kGl4155z5"},"_id":"p1Gz3MdAStaAH1bK","folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"aD9eqh5kGl4155z5":3}}
